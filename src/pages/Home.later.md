This is an easy way to create an image of a certain size.

Just use the following URL:

You can customize your image if you want by adding a theme name or background color in RGB format:

    https://b64.tools/placeholder/width/height/f00 # This generates a red image

    https://b64.tools/placeholder/width/height/puppies # This generates an image with puppies

    https://b64.tools/placeholder/width/height/kittens # This generates an image with kittens
